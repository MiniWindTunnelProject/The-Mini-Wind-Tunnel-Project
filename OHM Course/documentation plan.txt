Documentation plan:

This will be written in GitBuilding.
Although this presents a higher barrier to entry than word or notepad, it will pay dividends in the future when the documentation becomes large and edits need to be made
In addition, it is more inkeeping with the principles of open-hardware

It will be highly likely that I will not complete all of this by the end of the course, however
by starting with a good framework and strucutre, it will get me over the initial hurdle and set 
the project going.

Split the documentation into:

	Overall bill of materials - needs logical naming structure
	Manufacture:
		Laser cutting
		3D printing
		Off-the-shelf components (need alternative products)
		(Bill of materials in each sub-section for clarity)
	Assembly:
		Wind tunnel
			Motor box - already completed the assembly drawings
			Diffuser 
			Test section
			Contraction
		Experiments
			Inclined manometer
			Wing force measurement
			Cylinder
			Smoke flow visualisation
	Operation:
		Safety!!
		Wind tunnel
		Inclined manometer
		Wing force measurement
		Cylinder
		Smoke flow visualisation

	Teaching material: - this will be developed with teachers from the Bristol school
		Preliminary material for teachers
		Lesson plans and handouts for each experiment

I expect the documentation to have both instructional videos and written documents
The videos can be hosted on youtube and linked in GitBuilding.
The university has good facilities for making such videos that I can use.

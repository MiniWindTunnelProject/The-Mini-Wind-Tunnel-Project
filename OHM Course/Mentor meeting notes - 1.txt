=== Mentor meeting 1 ===

- Date: 18/10/2022
- Attendees: Barbara & Sam

== Agenda == 

1. Recap from previous meeting (or expectations & goals if this is your 1st meeting)

	First meeting
	Talked through history and vision of the project
	Discussed some tangible outputs for the OHM course:
		Website/landing page: The project needs a proper home; a place where people can be directed to.
		This c

2. This weekâ€™s reading and assignment: questions, doubts, challenges?

	Canvas complete. Looks OK, will need tweaking as the project progresses.
	Still unsure about the licensing for this project. More reading required.

3. Timeline: how are we doing?

	On track. The canvas has been completed and Barbara made a good point about keeping the two threads of this project separate.
   	Thread 1: Open-source design - community of users and coontributors
	Thread 2: Tunnels are built at the University of Bath and given to schools, with educational material for free (funded by the Department of Mechanical Engineering)

	Thread 1 is where I will be focussing my efforts on this OHM course.
	

4. Contacting experts: do we need specific help from someone?
	
	Not currently needed

5.  Any other questions or comments

	Ultimately this project will need educational material to go with the experimetns. This will be in the form of documents/videos, which is a large undertaking
	Barbara suggested, for now, I could include a "what's next?" page on my website to outline my goals here.
	I can then have a contact box for contributors who want to get involved in designing the educational material

== Actions for next meeting == 
- Ask cohort/organisers about most appropriate platform to host design/assembly plans. e.g. Do these come with in-built forums?
- Define a realistic timeline, in two-week chunks, that will allow me to acheive my goals
- Define a mission statement for the website
- Keep doing the homework!
